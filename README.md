## Two Pointer

Defunct algorithm only shows a minimal improvement in pads. It's not worth the computational complexity

Theoretical bounds:
Ring: m=3: 1333, m=4:1500
Two Pointer: m=3: 1333, m=4:1500

Practially the same. For a very large d, it would seem to make a difference. However, it largey does not matter.
