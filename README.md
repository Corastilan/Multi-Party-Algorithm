## Adaptive Boundary Protocol

First attempt at creating an algorithm. This was eventually built upon to create our ring simulation.

Implementation of the third algorithm. Check [here](TeX/Adaptive_Boundary_Protocol.pdf) for details.

Dependencies: 
Python interpreter (3.10 or higher preferred)
Pytest 

# Pytest
simply run the following:
```bash
pytest
```

All tests should run. If not, cd into tests/
